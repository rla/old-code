<h1>The Indexer</h1>
<div class="spacing"></div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The Indexer is full-text search engine that is optimized for search speed over very large
document collections.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Support for partial words, like sp*d (would match speed)</li>
  <li>Weighted results using term vectors</li>
  <li>Very simple API</li>
  <li>Support for specified encoding (or subset of it)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Character Encoding</h2>
<p>
The Indexer uses character mapper that maps every multibyte character
into one byte. This is required for trigram indexing.
</p>

<h2>Partial matching</h2>
<p>
For search queries that use wildcards in the words we use the trigram indexing. Every indexed word
is splitten into three-byte vectors. The word ID is saved into B-tree in separated file.
To get the tree id we use digital tree to store three-byte vectors. Every three-byte
vector maps to distinct B-tree. Therefore we can easily
find all the words that correspond to the partial word in the query. The words themself are
stored in the packed form in sequencial file.
