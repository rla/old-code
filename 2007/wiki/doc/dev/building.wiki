= Building Desktop Wiki =

== Requirements ==

* jdk 1.6 or newer (1.7 b24 tested)
* ant (1.7.0 tested)


== Build sequence ==

Correct order of compilation of sub-projects:

* rl-common
* nondet-java
* parser-tokenizer
* wiki-parser
* text-template
* desktop-wiki

== Build scripts ==

=== Local build skripts ===

In every subproject there is ''ant'' build script that can be used to build
the subproject locally.

**parser-tokenizer** requires bootstrap libraries to build therefore
command ''ant -file bootstrap.xml'' must be run in the directory
of subproject.

=== Global build scripts ===

* ''build.sh'' - builds everything.
* ''build-clean.sh'' - cleans project and builds everything (compiling for different vm).
* ''build-dist.sh'' - cleans project before and after building, makes one large package.
