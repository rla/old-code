1. In discretization, what should be the value of N? I think that this problem is not addressed in the skeleton.
2. Same as above for time discretization, maybe these should be in the common.py as constants.
3. Can we get an example of the Laplacian for some N for testing purposes?
4. In all formulas "delta x^2" is meant as "(delta x)^2"?
5. In page 5 we calculate b_i for step t+1 since we need u's from steps t and t-1?
