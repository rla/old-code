<br><br>
1. The majority of the existing lands on the planet have been discovered, explored and populated. Global and local problems can no longer be solved by territorial development. The evolution of governments has to occur from within existing governments instead of through the violent formation of new governments. 
<br><br>
2. The technology exists for the dominant species to eventually populate the Cosmos. 
<br><br>
3. The technology exists to alter the information of Life and the dominate species is faced with moral choices beyond the scope of existing Myths and Religions. 
<br><br>
4. The dominate species is overpopulating their planet and destroying vital ecosystems. A dominant military warrior ruling class is emerging and declaring war on the artists, other creative people and the children. 
<br><br>
5. The destructive nature of certain existing technologies have become a threat to existing life on the planet. 
<br><br>
6. Conceptual diseases affect all areas of human thought and communications. As myths (including governments) become dysfunctional, they take on the characteristics of their antithetical forms. 
<br><br>
7. Because of overpopulation, the differences and needs of the dominate species are magnified to the point that wars occur over these differences and needs. 
<br><br>
8. Governments have become life and freedom denying instead of life and freedom affirming. 
<br><br>
9. Corruption and chaos make it impossible to distinguish between law enforcement and criminals and democracies and authoritarian governments. 
<br><br>
10. Governments have become so dysfunctional that the Courts are overburdened because the governments do not respond to the evolutionary needs and desires of the people. 
<br><br>
11. Government organizational structures exist above the humans they serve therefore are practically inaccessible. 
<br><br>
12. Compassion is missing in our society because our leaders and the media reinforce the We/They Conceptual Diseases about certain classes of people being below the normal protections provided an average citizen. It becomes acceptable behavior to abuse those citizens who do not embrace the "good" belief system. 
<br><br>
13. Two basic Classes are forming all over the Planet: The Haves and Have-Nots. Those who are computer literate and thus capable of supporting themselves and those who are not computer literate. Today, a quadriplegic who is computer literate can function, whereas, an otherwise healthy individual who is not computer literate is greatly handicapped. This difference is so great as to cause the rift between two different species. The anger between these two groups is expressed in "The Unibomber's" rage. 
<br><br>
14. The nature of warfare has evolved to the point that instead of one warrior killing another warrior, now one or two warriors can destroy an entire country if they choose. 
<br><br>
15. Our food sources are becoming less productive. Our demands for wealth and power are overtaxing the biosphere as we deny the reality of our overpopulation. Our governments seem less able to solve our problems. We as individuals seem less capable of solving our personal problems. The magnitude of our problems seem overwhelming.
<br><br><strong>What we could have ...</strong><br><br>
...the need for War is eliminated. Those who feel it necessary to play war games can do so in Virtual Reality without doing harm to others or the environment. Problems are solved and differences are dealt with before warfare would occur. Audio-Video Plays and Virtual Reality are used to resolve differences as a form of entertainment. Problem solving can be profitable and entertaining just as "soap operas" are produced today. 
<br><br>
...you could feel safe and have some idea of what tomorrow would bring. A collective, evolutionary myth would enable us to "look before we leap" into major social changes. The parallel, evolutionary, polymorphic government called L.O.V.E. would ensure every citizen input into the collective dream. 
<br><br>
...every human's needs are met. The technologies have been developed and can be refined to enable all citizens to build their own homes, grow their own food, manufacture their own clothes and process most of their own medicines. All controlled by multimedia computers. Medical care cost can be cut in half or more. 
<br><br>
...a country, a world, that solves its problems as they occur instead of waiting until a crisis occurs requiring law or military intervention. 
<br><br>
...a world wide financial construct that insures financial and social stability in an environment for healing and peace. The U.S. Federal Government's budget has been balanced and the tax base eliminated by requiring all federal agencies to demonstrate a profit. Welfare has been eliminated as well as government subsidies. The resources wasted in weapons research and development are now channeled into creating jobs, housing, and solving human problems. 
<br><br>
...a world where there are no Holy Wars. The Cosmic Bible and The Myth of RevKarm demonstrate through the concept of the Infinitely Nil Set the path for resolution of all human differences and conflicts. 
<br><br>
...a world where there is always a place for everyone "to fit" and all humans are seen as Moire' instead of being seen as different colors. A world where, by definition, all citizens are equal.
