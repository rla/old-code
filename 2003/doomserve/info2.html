	   Started server on Zdaemon .99 as "Doom Estonia"<br><br>
	   Welcome to the 1st Estonian Doom Server's homepage. The server is named on zdaemon "Doom Estonia". 
	   I hope you enjoy playing doom as much as I do. For this reason
	   i attempted to run my very own doom multiplayer server.<br><br>
	   This server is not meant to run 24/7. This is mostly because of technical reasons.
	   We have 384Kbps broadband connection but I hope to get much more bandwidth soon.
	   So do not complain now about lag or slow gameplay.<br><br>
	   We still have to test. I thank everybody who help me and do not whine much.<br><br>
	   For wads and other stuff please visit our <a href="download.html" target="alumine"><font face="verdana" size="2" color="#6666cc">download</font></a> area.
