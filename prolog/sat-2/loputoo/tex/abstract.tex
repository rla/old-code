In this thesis we study the problem of model counting of boolean formulas.
The model counting problem is closely related to boolean satisfiability
problem and it turns out that \textit{DPLL}-like backtracking
satisfiability algorithms are also suitable for the counting problem. We look at
the ideas behind \textit{DPLL} algorithm and implement it in Prolog programming
language. It appears that Prolog is suitable for solving these kind of problems
because of built-in backtracking and general suitability for symbol
manipulations. The developed implementation can also be integrated with other
Prolog programs.
