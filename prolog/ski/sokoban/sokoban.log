05:58 < SpiderByte77> anyone use Ciao in here?
06:35 -!- AtnNn [n=welcome@74.56.56.230] has quit ["strawberries"]
06:49 < vixey> no
06:49 < vixey> nobody uses cia
07:05 < SpiderByte77> vixey: really?
07:05 < SpiderByte77> heh heh
07:05 < SpiderByte77> i've just installed it. i have gnu prolog too
07:05 < SpiderByte77> just comparing them
07:05 < vixey> I like SWI a lot more
07:05 < SpiderByte77> do you dislike ciao?
07:05 < vixey> I dislike GNU prolog
07:06 < vixey> never tried ciau
07:06 < SpiderByte77> so far ciao is looking to be my personal favorite
07:06 < SpiderByte77> though i must say mercury has my attention for large development applications
07:07 < vixey> that's what it was designed for, I guess, they say
07:07 < SpiderByte77> i had a stupid ciao question when i logged in to the channel, but i solved it on my onesies ;P
07:08 < SpiderByte77> (i can never remember that it is "halt." and not "exit.", for some reason)
07:08 < SpiderByte77> heh heh
07:08 < SpiderByte77> vixey: what OS do you run SWI on?
08:49 < SpiderByte77> i just installed SWI via the macports standalone installer, and i see swipl in opt local bin
08:49 < SpiderByte77> but i *also* see pl in /usr/bin
08:50 < SpiderByte77> and i was just trying to track down how that got there
08:50 < SpiderByte77> was it installed with SWI?
08:50 < SpiderByte77> did it come with my mac in OSX Tiger?
08:50 < SpiderByte77> did i install it a few months ago and forget about it?
08:50 < SpiderByte77> anyone have any clues you can offer me?
09:12 < SpiderByte77> aHA! as it turns out, it's a native OSX app for dealing with Property Lists (hence, "pl")
09:12 < SpiderByte77> in case that helps anyone... heh heh.
09:12 < SpiderByte77> thanks all the same. ;]
09:12 < vixey> hi
09:14 < SpiderByte77> hi vixey
09:14 < SpiderByte77> are you on a mac?
09:14 < SpiderByte77> i came across a strange naming conflict in osx, per my above entries there
09:14 < vixey> why
09:14 < SpiderByte77> i was just trying out SWI, per your recommendation
09:14 < vixey> yeah swi is cool
09:15 < vixey> maybe I'll write a puzzle game
09:15 < SpiderByte77> and upon searching for the top level environment binary, i found a "pl" in /usr/bin, but it wasn't SWI! heh heh
09:15 < SpiderByte77> it confused me at first, because the SWI docs say its binary is called pl
09:15 < SpiderByte77> but via macports, it is named swipl
09:15 < vixey> You should probably email the SWI people about that
09:15 < SpiderByte77> yes, i think i shall
09:15 < vixey> because it really is called swipl
09:16 < vixey> if you are in SWI pl try this
09:16 < vixey> ?- help.
09:16 < vixey> you might have to open X11
09:18 < SpiderByte77> i haven't finished installing it. well i have, but not yet updated in .bashrc
09:19 < vixey> dunno why you are putting crap in .bashrc instead of .profile
09:19 < SpiderByte77> so x11 will see it
09:19 < SpiderByte77> for some reason, that's what xterm loads in x11, not .profile
09:19 < vixey> oh
09:19 < vixey> you can run swi from terminal
09:20 < vixey> but have X11 open because help will open some windows in there
09:20 < SpiderByte77> yeah, the mac is wonderful, but sometimes a bit confusing on its terminal stuff, how they've chosen to work thru things
09:20 < SpiderByte77> ah, ok
09:20 < SpiderByte77> i'll give that a try once its ready
09:20 < vixey> all software and OSs and build systems is completely screwed
09:20 < vixey> there's no hope
09:21 < SpiderByte77> (multi-tasking some other work just at the moment)
09:21 < SpiderByte77> haha. that's a bit fatalistic, don't you think?
09:21  * vixey to
09:22 < SpiderByte77> to?

12:26 < vixey> ok
12:26 < vixey> SpiderByte77: Are you still here?
12:27 < RLa> hey vixey
12:27 < vixey> hi RLa!
12:35 < vixey> Do you want to try my game? :)
12:36 < vixey> http://rafb.net/p/hJA1MN58.html
12:38 < vixey> sokoban
12:39 < vixey> would be very nice actually to know better ways to write index and edit and display
12:39 < vixey> other than that it's fine
12:41 < vixey> going to do it in XPCE once I get SWI reinstalled..
12:43 < RLa> sokoban
12:46 < RLa> it's np-hard i see
12:46 < SpiderByte77> vixey: yes, i'm back now
12:46 < vixey> yaa
12:46 < vixey> SpiderByte  I wanted you to try my game
12:47 < SpiderByte77> will do
12:47 < SpiderByte77> haven't yet finished my install
12:47 < SpiderByte77> heh heh. i'm trying to do way too much at once
12:47 < SpiderByte77> ;P
12:48 < SpiderByte77> i've downloaded the source from that link though
12:48 < SpiderByte77> give me a few minutes
12:48 < SpiderByte77> vixey: are you m/f?
12:49 < SpiderByte77> out of random curiousity.
12:49 < vixey> f
12:51 -!- prunedtree [i=Aozaru@195.140.142.184] has joined #prolog
12:51 < SpiderByte77> ahHA, i was right
12:51 < SpiderByte77> =)
12:53 -!- hukolele [n=hukolele@134.Red-83-61-90.dynamicIP.rima-tde.net] has joined #prolog
12:54 < SpiderByte77> also, and again just out of curiousity (am i spelling that word right?), what is the filename you saved your game under?
12:54 < SpiderByte77> so i get the *official* experience ;]
12:54 < vixey> sokoban.pl
12:54 < SpiderByte77> cool
12:54 < SpiderByte77> i should be able to fire it up in about 30 minutes
12:56 < SpiderByte77> actually, i dropped what i was doing and have it up and running right now
12:57 < SpiderByte77> just one problem... i don't know how to play sokoban! ;P
12:57 < SpiderByte77> i got the ! to move right
12:57 < SpiderByte77> what is my goal?
12:57 < vixey> hehe
12:57 < vixey> you can try to push the $'s onto the _'s to win
12:57 < vixey> @ is what it looks like when you put a gold into a space
12:58 < SpiderByte77> ooh, wow! i like this =)
12:59 < SpiderByte77> but i'm not very good at it yet. heh heh. can't figure out how to get the $ out of the lower part just yet
13:01 < SpiderByte77> i'm chalking that up to user error though. ;]
13:01 < SpiderByte77> this is a very nice bit of code!
13:01 < vixey> thank you
13:01 < SpiderByte77> how long did it take you?
13:01 < vixey> about 5 mins
13:01 < vixey> I am kind of thinking about writing a kit for kids to make puzzle games with
13:02 < SpiderByte77> like an api?
13:02 < vixey> well a GUI to make tiles and levels and a kind of IDE that helps you code it
13:02 < SpiderByte77> wow, that sounds excellent!
13:03 < SpiderByte77> i'm all about kids and programming
13:03 < RLa> i modified controls a bit
13:03 < SpiderByte77> i started when i was 8 years old, and found my calling early in life as a result ;]
13:03 < RLa> u,d,l,r and no dot required
13:04 < SpiderByte77> nice! same paste address?
13:04 < vixey> yeah and if I get them started on Prolog ... can't be a bad thing
13:04 < SpiderByte77> true - there's a decided lack of Prolog-for-youngsters from what i can see
13:05 < SpiderByte77> Logo, yes. Java, Basic, Smalltalk even
13:05 < SpiderByte77> but i haven't seen a project yet to take them the "logical" route
13:05 < SpiderByte77> i'm actually writing a course in programming right now, working with Scratch from MIT
13:05 < SpiderByte77> (for kids, as well)
13:06 < SpiderByte77> i've got the first two chapters done
13:06 < vixey> oh cool
13:06 < SpiderByte77> i'm including real world activities like making tools and primitive machines in clay
13:06 < vixey> what sort of things do you cover?
13:06 < vixey> wow
13:06 < SpiderByte77> i'm going from pre-computer history all the way up through 26 languages in practical use
13:07 < SpiderByte77> with major stops in Scratch and Basic for theory
13:07 < SpiderByte77> Chipmunk Basic, to be precise
13:08 < SpiderByte77> i don't anticipate student fluency in all 26 languages, but they'll be familiar with why there are different ones available
13:08  * vixey nod
13:09 < vixey> when we had computing in school, we got a pretty wide range of languages. that was certainly a good way to start out
13:09 < vixey> getting locked into one mindset isn't helpful
13:09 < SpiderByte77> i think it expands the creativity of the mind so much simply to be made aware of other ways of thinking, even if they aren't put to
                      lucrative use in a person's life
13:10 < SpiderByte77> very true
13:10 < SpiderByte77> i love catalyzing epiphanies. ;]
13:12 < SpiderByte77> would your Prolog kit for kids be oriented towards education, play/exploration, or both?
13:12 < vixey> just for fun
13:13 < SpiderByte77> i would love to have something like that for my daughter when she is old enough
13:14 < RLa> http://rafb.net/p/CGm0ir18.html
13:14 < RLa> <- only u,d,l,r needs to enter, no separate 'enter' is required
13:15 < vixey> ty RLa
13:15 < vixey> hows your system coming? have you added to it?
13:16 < SpiderByte77> which one?
13:16 < vixey> RLa's Prolog
13:16 < vixey> (implementation)
13:17 < RLa> oh, havn't released last version
13:17 < RLa> added some garbage collection
13:17 < RLa> but i will redesign it a bit
13:18  * SpiderByte77 's dumb self didn't see the different nickname was typing
13:18 < RLa> no caching of functors and atoms, that causes garbage problems
13:18 < RLa> otherwise i use it already in my declarative web crawler
13:18 < SpiderByte77> would it be possible to repaint characters in the same screen region?
13:18 < SpiderByte77> (vixey?)
13:19 < RLa> it works etremely well, allowing me to replace crawling rules at runtime
13:19 < RLa> generally it allows any code to be replace while program is running
13:19 < vixey> SpiderByte77: I think so (I think SWI comes with ncurses bindings) but I would like to have real graphics (bitmaps)
13:19 < vixey> RLa: ahh cool
13:20 < RLa> already running query will still use last version of code for consistency
13:20 < RLa> also improved java side, classpath can be modified at runtime
13:20 < RLa> that's something that jpl cannot do easily
13:21 < SpiderByte77> RLa: what is this you're working on? a webcrawler?
13:21 < SpiderByte77> oh - *reads up a few lines* - an entire prolog version?
13:21 < RLa> yes, i use for making offline copies of important sites
13:22 < RLa> SpiderByte77, it's not iso-prolog compatible
13:22 < vixey> who cares about iso :p
13:22 < RLa> since it's missing dynamic operators
13:22 < RLa> yes
13:22 < RLa> i even thought about giving up cut
13:22 < vixey> replacing with ifte and once?
13:22 < vixey> or what?
13:22 < SpiderByte77> RLa: wait, so - it *is* a webcrawler, but to achieve it you are creating your own Prolog implementation?
13:23 < RLa> i have recently studied mercury system, and yes, it can be done without cut
13:23 < RLa> yes, if-then-else or more general 'switch' that mercury uses
13:24 < RLa> SpiderByte77, i needed prolog->java->prolog->java interface (bidirection inerface)
13:24 < RLa> swi's jpl can do it but after two runs it segfaults
13:24 < SpiderByte77> ah
13:25 < RLa> SpiderByte77, i did not write it from scratch, i took w-prolog as base
13:25 < dmiles_afk> RLa, out of local trail ?
13:25 < SpiderByte77> still.. wow, that is one way to really, *really* get the job done in prolog
13:25 < dmiles_afk> RLa, JPL: out of local trail ?
13:25 < SpiderByte77> heh heh
13:25 < RLa> http://www.rl.pri.ee/rl-prolog/
13:26 < RLa> dmiles_afk, you had similar problem but got it fixed?
13:26 < dmiles_afk> RLa, yes, the fix wasonly commited last week
13:26 < RLa> oh
13:27 < RLa> well, at least i have pure java implementation
13:27 < RLa> and it's faster than other java implementations that use interpretation not compilation
13:29 < SpiderByte77> RLa: so you're writing in Java, and then coding the webcrawler in RL-Prolog?
13:29 < SpiderByte77> (writing RL-Prolog in Java?)
13:29 < vixey> where is mercurys switch described?
13:30 < vixey> http://www.mercury.csse.unimelb.edu.au/information/documentation.html somewhere in here?
13:30 < RLa> a sec
13:30 < SpiderByte77> strange, i was just on that very page, but at a different URL
13:31 < SpiderByte77> http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/research/mercury/information/documentation.html
13:31 < vixey> I'm trying to decide what language and implementation to use
13:31 < SpiderByte77> and i still haven't beaten your game yet, vixey
13:31 < SpiderByte77> heh heh
13:32 < SpiderByte77> is there a trick to getting something away from a wall?
13:32 < vixey> it's a tricky one :)
13:32 < RLa> mercury tutorial
13:32 < RLa> it was described there
13:34 < vixey> ok I get it
13:34 < SpiderByte77> vixey: join #mercury; they could use some more nicks logged in there
13:34 < SpiderByte77> i haven't seen a room so empty in a long while
13:34 < SpiderByte77> ;P
13:35 < RLa> (X = 1, do_stuff; X = 2, do_else, ...)
13:37 < RLa> SpiderByte77, the plumbing stuff (http requests, queues, threads, link extraction) is written in Java but the rules what to crawl are written as
             Prolog program
13:38 < SpiderByte77> i like the sokoban game with get_key
13:38 < SpiderByte77> RLa: ah, very cool.
13:39 < RLa> there are only three rules: preprocessing, saving and expanding rule
13:39 < SpiderByte77> what is the performance like, as compared to what it would-have/may be in all-java?
13:39 < RLa> preprocessing rules cut off most crap by url patterns, others my look at http headers or/and contents
13:40 < RLa> SpiderByte77, performance is network io bound
13:40 < SpiderByte77> i knew that.
13:40 < SpiderByte77> haha
13:40 < SpiderByte77> what was i thinking?
13:40 < SpiderByte77> webcrawling...network.
13:40  * SpiderByte77 has been up working too long
13:41 < RLa> the prolog implementation can do about 3M inferences per sec
13:42 < SpiderByte77> do you have a metric on a java equivalent in comparison?
13:42 < RLa> metrics about relevance or performance or throughput?
13:43 < SpiderByte77> performance
13:43 < SpiderByte77> compared to the prolog inferences per sec
13:43 < RLa> depends on rules, again
13:44 < RLa> for total crawling, it will always be network that's bottleneck
13:44 < SpiderByte77> well, for the rest of this decade at least ;P
13:45 < SpiderByte77> quantum physics may deprecate even fiber before we know it. heh heh.
13:45 < RLa> previosly i have coded up some learing algorithms, one that propagated page goodness around link graph was slow
13:45 < RLa> it was only able to propagate up to depth 8
13:46 < RLa> since some pages contained hundreds of links
13:46 < RLa> most of cpu was probably wasted in synchronization
13:46 < RLa> since many threads worked on the graph
13:47 < SpiderByte77> would it choke up, or did it crash it?
13:47 < SpiderByte77> (going past 8 levels)
13:47 < RLa> later i made it adaptive for cpu usage by propagation time, if time > 1sec it decreased depth, similar with lower bound
13:47 < RLa> choke up
13:48 < RLa> memory problems as well
13:48 < SpiderByte77> sort of like nice'ing the well-behaved threads?
13:48 < SpiderByte77> was it leaking memory?
13:49 < RLa> since whole graph was kept in memory and for some pages the contents was also kept in memory through the links for lazy content download
13:49 < RLa> yes, it was 'leaking'
13:51 < RLa> the algorithm was not very efficient in relevance wise compared to depth-first search with hand coded hack-rules
13:52 < SpiderByte77> how often do you run the crawls?
13:52 < RLa> some rules were in the form: "if this url page lead to 100 useless pages, do not search any link from this page anymore"
13:52 < RLa> depends what i wanted to download
13:53 < SpiderByte77> so you must be pulling these results into a DB, yes?
13:53 < RLa> most of time, text files were sufficient
13:54 < SpiderByte77> csv? custom?
13:54 < RLa> and of course, downloaded pages wnt directly into disk and links were rewritten for easy browsing
13:54 < RLa> depends what information was needed to save
13:54 < RLa> most of time it was url-filename correspondence
13:55 < SpiderByte77> oh, wow, so it is not just crawling - you're recreating link networks on a local machine, eh?
13:55 < RLa> some later time i added jdbc interface to it
13:55 < RLa> yes
13:55 < RLa> and incremental crawling and rewriting of links
13:55 < SpiderByte77> is this for something like a search engine?
13:55 < RLa> and of course the software became more and more complex
13:56 < RLa> no
13:56 < SpiderByte77> are you an engineer at cuil.com? ;P
13:56 < SpiderByte77> heh heh
13:56 < RLa> no
13:56 < RLa> for creating offline high-quality copies
13:56 < RLa> i have written it couple of times from cratch
13:57 < RLa> first version was in php
13:57 < RLa> next one was bunch of shell scripts
13:57 < RLa> then first version in java
13:57 < RLa> then second one
13:58 < RLa> and i have studied many other implementations of such software
13:58 < SpiderByte77> that's really cool
13:58 < RLa> like heritrix (used for archive.org)
13:58 < RLa> and many eperimental tools
13:58 < vixey> yeah very cool
13:59 < vixey> I think that lots of people could use your system for other things
14:00 < RLa> hm, maybe i should realease current version
14:01 < RLa> i have already written simple general rulesets for downloading directory listings etc
14:01 < RLa> the largest dataset i have crawled is estonian largest online social network
14:02 < RLa> it produced 29GB data
14:02 < RLa> and took two months to crawl
14:03 < RLa> it was crawled with php version :)
14:03 < SpiderByte77> yowza.
14:03 < RLa> yes, it never needed restart
14:03 < SpiderByte77> PHP5?
14:03 < RLa> and was run on p3 with 256MB memory
14:03 < RLa> php4
14:04 < SpiderByte77> what OS?
14:04 < RLa> slackware 10 :)
14:05 < SpiderByte77> nice
14:05 < RLa> the files were saved in one directory
14:05 < RLa> it contained more than 1M of files
14:05 < SpiderByte77> ouch
14:05 < RLa> fs was reiser :)
14:05 < SpiderByte77> even typing "ls" would take a while
14:05 < RLa> yes, dir listing was slow
14:06 < RLa> for later versions i added directory partition
14:06 < SpiderByte77> i think if i had a data set like that, i would manually disable the "locate" command for safety. haha.
14:07 < RLa> hehe
14:07 < SpiderByte77> now, is this a commercial pursuit, or a personal project?
14:07 < RLa> purely personal
14:07 < SpiderByte77> hardcore, man
14:07 < SpiderByte77> wow
14:08 < RLa> it was very interesting
14:08 < RLa> most version of crawlers were quite small in code lines #
14:09 < RLa> 200-300 lines, except the first java version

14:09 < SpiderByte77> yeah. 6,000 is quite a difference
14:09 < RLa> current version w/o prolog is about 1-2k lines

14:10 < vixey> I'm very unsure what to do

14:11 < vixey> I could try to use SWI, or mercury, or add enough bits to my compiler as I go..
14:11 < SpiderByte77> vixey: for your puzzle kit?
14:11 < vixey> yes
14:12 < SpiderByte77> the kids will be working with their own source code, in addition to the gui, yes?
14:12 < SpiderByte77> (or IDE, if i recall)
14:12 -!- syamajala2 [n=syamajal@c-24-61-31-104.hsd1.ma.comcast.net] has joined #prolog
14:13 < vixey> I'm not very sure yet
14:18 < SpiderByte77> well, if the kids do use an IDE to work on a language directly, i'd imagine you would want to choose a language that you would like for
                      the kids to know
14:18 < SpiderByte77> ;]
14:19 < SpiderByte77> i can relate though; i'm unsure as to which language to use for Project D
14:19 < SpiderByte77> it may be largely driven by the team that is assembling
14:19 < SpiderByte77> experience / preference among the members
14:20 < SpiderByte77> but i would likely press towards mercury out of interest in seeing it put to use
14:23 < RLa> mercury is not very good for experimental stuff
14:23 < RLa> too verbose :)
14:23 < vixey> I'm kind of scared to use mercury
14:24 < vixey> I am guessing that a lot of techniques I do might be rejected
14:24 < RLa> kids might like dataflow-based programming
14:25 < RLa> i think i have seen some interactive enviroments
14:25 < RLa> for 'programming'
14:28 < vixey> oh
14:28 < vixey> "Mercury does not (yet) allow users to define their own operators."
14:28  * vixey wont be using that then ........
14:28 < SpiderByte77> heh heh
14:29 < SpiderByte77> i had to ask them over there
14:29 < SpiderByte77> hee hee hee
14:30 < SpiderByte77> (in #mercury)
14:31 < SpiderByte77> huh?! i was expecting an awkward silence.. guess they've added it in?
14:31 < SpiderByte77> bonus? heh heh
14:32 < vixey> mistake
14:32 < SpiderByte77> heh heh. thought you were giving him a hard time, too

14:45 < vixey> what's new?
14:45 < SpiderByte77> changed a couple chars, and keys to asdw (gamer keys)
14:46 < vixey> :D
14:46  * vixey wsad is a bit awkward for dvorak..
14:47 < SpiderByte77> haha
14:47 < SpiderByte77> what gamer uses dvorak, tho?
14:47 < SpiderByte77> ;P
14:47 < SpiderByte77> hmm, well - what are the codes for the arrow keys?
14:48 < SpiderByte77> i'd have to look that up...
14:48 < vixey> get_single_char/1 doesn't like arrow keys much
14:48 < SpiderByte77> what keys are in the QWERTY-equivalent w, asd positions on dvorak?

14:49 < vixey> yes
14:49 < SpiderByte77> then aoe where asd go?
14:49 < SpiderByte77> give me two seconds ;P
14:52 < SpiderByte77> darn. "e" is also exit.
14:53 < SpiderByte77> and i'm not sure if putting ',' is right
14:53 < vixey> I think that is correct
14:53 < vixey> you don't need to though
14:53 < vixey> i.e. foo(x,,,y) works
14:54 < SpiderByte77> wowzers
14:54 < SpiderByte77> k

14:56 < SpiderByte77> yay!

14:56 < SpiderByte77> and it works with both dvorak and qwerty game keys ;]
14:57 < vixey> ahh nice :)
14:58 < vixey> ski, wow I just discovered pure io
14:58 < vixey> ski, it turns out that SWI already has support for DCG on streams
15:02 < SpiderByte77> vixey: i just won! haha. took me long enough. ;P
15:03 < vixey> :))
15:03 < SpiderByte77> i like that a lot - thank you for sharing it!
15:03 < SpiderByte77> well, we vampires don't do well in sunlight. i'd better wrap things up for the day
15:04 < SpiderByte77> laterz, all
15:04 < vixey> bye, was fun chatting :)
15:04 < ski> vixey : oh
15:05 < ski> (you mean pure io in mercury ?)
15:05 < vixey> no it's a library in SWI
15:05 < ski> ok
15:05 < ski> well i didn't know about that one
15:05 < ski> ty
15:08  * ski has fun playing sokoban
15:10 < RLa> is the solvable at all?
15:10 < RLa> that*
15:10 < ski> SpiderByte77 claimed so
15:11  * ski wants to backtrack ;)
15:12 < vixey> wow my game was a hit :D
15:13 < ski> You have won!?-
15:13 < ski> :D
15:14 < ski> ty vixey
15:16 < ski> RLa : if you can't figure out how to solve it, make a prolog program that solves it !
15:16 < RLa> :)
15:22 < RLa> heh, you can move @ too
15:22 < RLa> it becomes $
15:24 < RLa> ok, moved it temporaly up then moved right $ up and previous $ back again

16:38 < RLa> sec, i upload it
16:38 < RLa> it can be done with less moves
16:39 < ski> *nod*, i had 35 right
16:39 < RLa> http://pastebin.com/m7d2b5d9f
16:40 < RLa> 31 moves
16:42 < RLa> 30 moves
16:43 < ski> (hm, you didn't extend SpiderByte77's version)
16:46 < RLa> ok, i think i can't do in less
16:46 < RLa> no wasd keys?
16:47 < RLa> oh damn
16:47 < RLa> line 31 is only difference for move counting
16:47 < RLa> i wonder how you got 35 moves
16:53 < ski> ok, 30 moves now
16:53 < ski> for some reason i moved one block i a slightly more roundabout way than needed
16:53 < ski> s/i a/in a/
16:54 < RLa> i wonder if there is an easy way to generate solvable boards
16:54 < ski> would you like too compare with my moves ?
16:54 < ski> RLa : interesting idea
16:55 < RLa> for some reason i think you have same moves
16:56 < ski> quite possible :)
16:57 < RLa> what was your 6th move?
16:57 < RLa> down?
16:57 < ski> counting from 0 or 1 ?
16:57 < RLa> 1
16:58 < ski> left
17:01 < ski> hm, strange ..
17:01 < ski> echoing the move sequence into the program got me

17:17 < RLa> i'm not sure
17:17 < RLa> indeed, it's missing
17:17 < ski> since i have the same sequence as you, except i had a final `up' (and when i was counting for myself now, i got 31 moves)

09:21 < RLa> i think it's broken environment ( debian)

09:21 < RLa> and yes, compiling for single grade is much much faster

10:42 < RLa> 0.13 only
11:05 < vixey> oh
11:05 < vixey> I just read about superhomogenous form
11:05 < vixey> this is really neat
11:09 < SpiderByte77> vixey: what's that?
11:10 < vixey> an intermediate language in mercury
11:10 < vixey> http://www.mercury.csse.unimelb.edu.au/information/papers/unif.ps.gz
11:10 < vixey> they way they've set it up means you never have to dereference
11:11 < SpiderByte77> an intermediate language? like, macro stuff?
11:21 < RLa> hm, nice code for updating tile:
11:21 < RLa> !:State = ((!.State) ^ board := list.det_replace_nth(!.State ^ board, Point ^ y + 1, list.det_replace_nth(list.det_index0(!.State ^ board, Point ^

12:40 < RLa> i liked those state variables, those could make their way into usual prolog
12:41 < RLa> game_state ---> state(point::point, board::board)
12:41 < RLa> <- ideally, it should contain io state as well
12:41 < ski> oh, like that
12:41 < ski> ok
12:42 < RLa> "it is not possible to use nested unique modes, i.e. modes in which anything but the top level of a variable is unique."
12:43 < ski> *nod*
12:43 < RLa> i think that was the problem
12:44 < vixey> state variables
12:44 < vixey> what is the advantage over --> notation?
12:44 < RLa> --> can be used for state variables
12:44 < ski> mainly that you can have several state variables, i thin
12:44 < ski> k
12:45 < RLa> in the program there is --> used for game state in some preds, but for io in others

13:19 < ski> not exactly .. i got stuck reading a book "Topology via Logic" :)
13:20 < ski> (more specifically, topology applied to programming datatypes)
13:23  * ski curses the heat that turns his brain to moosh
13:23 < vixey> hey
13:24 < vixey> I wonder if HTML is a good gui for what I was thinking about
13:24 < vixey> I could run a webserver in prolog and then one could use a browser to interact with it
13:24 < ski> for kid games ?
13:25 < SpiderByte77> ski: hey, where are you that's so hot these days?
13:25 < ski> scandinavia

13:27 < ski> maybe about 25 degrees celsius (outdoor termometer says 30, but that's partially in the sun)
13:28 < SpiderByte77> i lived in Siberia (Krasnoyarsk) for two months during the summer a few years ago, and i was surprised how hot it was
13:28 < SpiderByte77> heh heh
13:28 < ski> what were you doing in siberia ?
13:29 < SpiderByte77> renovating an orphanage
13:30 < SpiderByte77> its hovering around 35C here in GA, USA
13:30 < SpiderByte77> and about 85+% humidity. you've got it easy. ;P
13:30 < SpiderByte77> heh heh
13:30 < SpiderByte77> what part of scandinavia are you in?
13:31 < SpiderByte77> i help out with a company in the Netherlands, doing internationalization for their US website
13:31 < ski> southern

13:32 < SpiderByte77> you can see my smiling face on their site: http://www.symbaloo.com/us/network
13:32 < SpiderByte77> heh heh
13:32 < ski> volunteer ?
13:32 < SpiderByte77> (David - the one at the bottom, under United States)
13:33 < SpiderByte77> yes, and that only on occasions I am needed
13:33 < SpiderByte77> just brush-ups on english where needed
13:33 < SpiderByte77> which isn't much - they've mostly got it down. ;]
13:34 < ski> it ?
13:34 < SpiderByte77> their english
13:34 < ski> the orphanage ?
13:34 < ski> oh
13:34 < SpiderByte77> oh, no no - i switched subjects, sorry
13:34 < SpiderByte77> the orphanage was in Russia
13:34 < SpiderByte77> smack dab in the middle
13:35 < SpiderByte77> 5+ days on a train in either direction to the nearest border
13:35 < SpiderByte77> east or west
13:35 < SpiderByte77> our team was glad to get back to civilization when we left and went to Moscow
