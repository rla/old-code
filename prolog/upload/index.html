<h1>Homepage uploading tool</h1>
<div class="spacing"></div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This tool will help to upload your (static) homepage. How it works:
it looks for an index file in current directory. The uploading uses FTP
transfer. The program will look into the index file and uploads every local
file that is linked to it. For each linked local html file it recursively
executes itself. This results in upload where only the files linked to html
pages are uploaded.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Firstly unzip the distribution and then install it using make. The default install
will put the program in system-wide directory and requires root access to do that.
However, you can install the tool manually into your own home dirctory as well.</p>
<pre>
:# make install
</pre>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>In your home directory there should be a file
called .upload.pl. The file contains configuration for the upload program.<br />
Example contents:
<pre>
% Configuration

% The remote root of homepage files
remote_root('ftp://user:pass@ftp.host.com/path/to/web/root').

% Local root of homepage files.
% The default construct points to user home directory (~).
local_root(R):- expand_file_name('~', [R]).
</pre>
</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<pre>
:$ upload
</pre>
